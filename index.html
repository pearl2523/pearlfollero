                    <p class="text">Sewing is my absolute favorite hobby. a true labor of love that connects me with my family's legacy.
                        I first learned the basic when i was in 1st year highschool through our TLE class, but my passion really ignited when u repeated
                        grade 11 and pursued dressmaking. Inspired by the tradition of sewing in my family, my grandparent, my mother, and my father all
                        honed this skill. I began crafting a variety of pieces, from a pajama to a classic Filipiniana, dresses skirts, and blouses. Although
                        some of my earlier projects are now just a fond of memories, my well-kept sewing machine still buzzes with requests from my family for
                        both hand-stitched and machin-made creations.</p>

                    <h3 class="name">CROCHETING</h3>
                    <p class="text">Crocheting became my creative escape during grade 9 when the pandemic hit. In our
                        Handicraft class, I struggled with project plans, and the lockdown boredom nudged me to
                        explore a forgotten stash of acrylic yarn and crochet hooks. Initially reluctant, I soon
                        discovered that crochet offered endless possibilities‚Äîfrom cozy accessories to fun home
                        decor. Some of my favorite projects include crocheted flowers, keychains, and easy-to
                       crochet crop tops, each a small celebration of creativity during challenging times.</p>

                    <h3 class="name">DOING MAKE-UP</h3>
                    <p class="text">Makeup, to me, is more than just a beauty routine‚Äîit's an art form that allows me to express
                        my personality and creativity. I started getting interested in makeup during the pandemic,
                        although I began wearing it when I was 15. My mom noticed my constant experimentation
                        and, upon returning from abroad with an assortment of products, introduced me to a
                        broader world of possibilities. Between 2021 and 2023, I embraced the half-glam look, but
                        now I lean towards a clean girl or soft glam style, partly because I have fewer products. Each
                        phase of my makeup journey has taught me new techniques and inspired unique styles</p>

                    <p class="text">One of my hobbies is listening to music and supporting my favorite idols,
                            whether in K-pop, P-pop, or OPM bands. I enjoy listening to songs by artists like
                            DWTA (Jhasmine Villanueva), Donnalyn Bartolome, and Janella Salvador, as
                            well as K-pop groups such as TWICE, BLACKPINK, EXO, BTS, SEVENTEEN,
                            GFRIEND, Red Velvet, and SNSD. Lately, I've also been into bands like Cup of
                            Joe and Oh! Caraga. In the P-pop scene, I admire BINI, SB19, GAT, P!xie, and
                            Raya, who are making waves with their great music. Don't forget to stream
                            MULTO by Cup of Joe!</p>

                    <p class="text1"> I began learning to play the guitar and ukulele when our Grade 9 MAPEH teacher introduced us to them.
                            Even though I'm not a pro, I still enjoy playing both Instruments. Since I gave my old guitar to a friend, i currently
                            borrow one while saving up for my own. I also use my cousin's ukulele whenever i feel like playing. I mostly play songs
                            with easy chords in guitar since i struggle with barre chords due to my short fingers, i continue to practice and improve.nd of memories, my well-kept sewing machine still buzzes with requests from my family for
                            both hand-stitched and machin-made creations.</p>

                    <h3 class="name1">CALLIGRAPHY</h3>
                    <p class="text1">I first explored calligraphy at 12 with just the basics‚Äîsimple strokes and letters. Back then, it
                        was something I'd do whenever I had a moment, using dual pens or colored pencils. A
                        turning point came when my mom returned from abroad with jars of vibrant color pens,
                        acrylic dual pens, and other supplies, sparking my curiosity even further. With these new
                        tools, I began experimenting and gradually refined my technique. Today, my calligraphy is
                        more polished and expressive, and it remains a joyful escape where I celebrate the art of
                        beautiful writing.</p>

                    <p class="text1">Dancing has also been one of my hobbies, but I don't do it as much anymore because I'm busy. I started dancing when I was a kid, taught by my Older cousins and Tita's.  ever since I learned to dance,  i would perform whenever there were youth activities at our church. In school, I would also occasionally lead dance exercises after the flag ceremony. My cousin and I used to cover K-pop dances for fun, but we never uploaded them because we were too shy. During the pandemic, dancing became one of our ways to stay active and fight boredom, though I wouldn,t say I,m great at it‚ÄîI just enjoy it.</p>
